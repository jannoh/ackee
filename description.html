<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The physical appearance of a pangolin is marked by large hardened overlapping plate-like scales, which are soft on newborn pangolins, but harden as the animal matures. They are made of keratin, the same material from which human fingernails and tetrapod claws are made, and are structurally and compositionally very different from the scales of reptiles. The pangolin's scaled body is comparable in appearance to a pine cone. It can curl up into a ball when threatened, with its overlapping scales acting as armor, while it protects its face by tucking it under its tail. The scales are sharp, providing extra defense from predators.</p>

<p>Pangolins can emit a noxious-smelling chemical from glands near the anus, similar to the spray of a skunk. They have short legs, with sharp claws which they use for burrowing into ant and termite mounds and for climbing.</p>

<p>The tongues of pangolins are extremely long and – like those of the giant anteater and the tube-lipped nectar bat – the root of the tongue is not attached to the hyoid bone, but is in the thorax between the sternum and the trachea. Large pangolins can extend their tongues as much as 40 <abbr title="centimeters" aria-label="centimeters">cm</abbr>  (16 <abbr title="inches" aria-label="inches">in</abbr>), with a diameter of only 0.5 <abbr title="centimeters" aria-label="centimeters">cm</abbr> 
(1⁄4 <abbr title="inches" aria-label="inches">in</abbr>).</p>
